# 🌍 Salesforce Carbon Footprint Tracker

## 📌 Project Overview
**Industry:** Sustainability / Environmental Management  
**Project Type:** Salesforce Sustainability CRM Implementation  
**Target Users:** Sustainability Officers, Compliance Teams, Business Leaders  

The **Salesforce Carbon Footprint Tracker** is a CRM-based solution designed to help organizations **collect, manage, analyze, and report carbon emission data** using Salesforce’s automation, analytics, and integration capabilities.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end Salesforce implementation** aligned with real-world sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) requirements.

## ❓ Problem Statement

In real-world organizations, carbon emission data is often difficult to manage due to:

- 🌐 **Fragmented Data Sources**  
  Energy consumption, logistics fuel usage, and employee travel data exist across ERP systems, spreadsheets, and third-party tools.

- 📝 **Manual & Error-Prone Tracking**  
  Sustainability teams rely heavily on Excel sheets, leading to inconsistent data, duplication, and human errors.

- 👁️ **Lack of Actionable Insights**  
  Even when data is available, organizations lack dashboards and KPIs to monitor emissions in real time.

These challenges make it difficult to:
- Meet regulatory and ESG compliance requirements  
- Track sustainability goals effectively  
- Communicate environmental impact to stakeholders  

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The key objectives of this project are to:

- Centralize carbon emission data within Salesforce  
- Automate emission data capture and validation  
- Provide real-time reporting and dashboards  
- Enable audit-ready sustainability reporting  
- Improve decision-making related to emission reduction  
- Build a scalable CRM solution aligned with industry practices

## 🌍 Real-World Example (IRL Scenario)

**Scenario: Manufacturing Company**

A manufacturing company consumes electricity across multiple plants, uses fuel for logistics, and reimburses employee travel expenses.

**Without this system:**
- Data is tracked in spreadsheets
- Monthly reports are delayed
- No visibility into high-emission sources

**With Carbon Footprint Tracker:**
- Emission data is automatically captured in Salesforce
- Dashboards show emissions by plant, source, and month
- Alerts notify teams when emissions exceed thresholds
- Management gets real-time sustainability insights
